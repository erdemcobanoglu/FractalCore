# FractalCore

**FractalCore** is a decentralized AI inference framework that transforms multiple client-side GPUs into a unified virtual graphics processing network.

By distributing image processing tasks across connected nodes, FractalCore simulates the behavior of a centralized GPU — empowering AI models to scale beyond local limitations using the collective power of participant devices.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔁 Distributed image segmentation and task allocation
- 🖥️ GPU-accelerated inference using ONNX Runtime
- 🌐 Lightweight orchestrator built with ASP.NET Core
- 🧩 Client SDK in C# for seamless integration
- 📦 Modular architecture for future blockchain/token integration

---

## 🧠 Use Case (MVP)

> Process large images in parallel across multiple clients:
> - The orchestrator splits an image into segments
> - Each client runs inference on a segment using its local GPU
> - Results are returned, merged, and sent back to the original requester
